# basic-keras-example

simple linear regression classifier using keras

Can be used as boilerplate code!

No control over random seed of Keras yet, Hence each training iteration (I mean compile-run iteration and not epochs!) will result in incosistent final weights and therefore inconsistent predictions for test data :(

The difference decreases drastically with increased epochs though.
